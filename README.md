# Visual3DConverter
Python based alternative to Convert3D to convert text files to Visual3D-readable text files.

# Usage
Change the sample rate when running as main (default 2000), or pass the sample rate into the function
Running as main will open a file selection window, each selected file will be processed separately (not concatenated)

# Why use this over Convert3D?
Convert3D is very slow and requires creation of templates for each run. This will automatically grab your header row and runs about 10x faster.
